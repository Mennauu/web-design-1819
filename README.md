## Introduction
This soundless podcast is made as part of a course from [@cmda-minor-web 18-19](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/browser-technologies-1819). In this course I had to create a podcast (in the form of a website) with the aim that Marie van Driessche can enjoy a podcast as much as someone who can hear the podcast.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content you may find:

- 📖: Documentation or article
- 🛠: Tool or library
- 📹: Video

## Research
The goal was to learn more about website design/accessibility for the Deaf (and Hearing Impaired).

  <summary>Read about my research</summary>

### Webdesign

With webdesign we have to consider how someone would move through life without the ability to hear. With this in mind I looked at some helpful tips to create a deaf-friendly website.

1. **Written language**

Deaf individuals use sign-language which is completely different than a standard written language. Reading skills in the hearing impaired community vary and need to be considered.

2. **Visual**

For deaf individuals, the visual experience is heightened. Graphic indicators to show purpose and other visual aids can support their understanding of the material.

3. **Transcripts and closed-captions**

Many websites and marketing platforms use audio and video presentations to connect and share their message. Including text-based transcripts with audio supplements and closed-captioning with videos offers engagement for the deaf.

4. **Contact**

Don't make telephone the only way to get in contact

## Meetings with Marie
I had 3 meetings with Marie. She always came with a talk/translator, which made it possible for us to have a normal conversation.

### First meeting

### Second meeting
Feedback:

- She didn't like it that the text from the second speaker would be going from right to left.
- She thought the timestamp was the amount of time it would take for the person to say it.
- She wanted more out of the emotion (it was kind of vague)
- She was confused there were 2 different bubbles even though it was the same speaker
- She liked the amount of emotions (that you can change it)

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->
## Wishlist
- [ ] Rewrite fallback code for looping audio files
- [ ] Rewrite code so the pleasureable functionality also works older browsers

<!-- Maybe I used some awesome sources that I can mention 🤔-->
